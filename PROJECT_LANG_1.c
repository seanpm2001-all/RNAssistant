The software has to be as reliable as possible for the hospitals and medical centers using it, and for the patients using it. It must pass evaluation before being used in a hospital, and needs to undergo tests when it gets to a working state. This software is a lot safer and would have a lesser impact upon failure, as long as a backup method is provided.
